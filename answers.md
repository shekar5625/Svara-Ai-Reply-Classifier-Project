1. If you only had 200 labeled replies, how would you improve the model without collecting thousands more?

I see 2 solutions to this.
I would try to apply data augmentation techniques, such as synonym replacement or back-translation, to synthetically increase the size and diversity of the training data. But data augmentaition to text dataset like the one we worked on wouldnt be practical and wouldnt make much difference in the models performance. 
So instead, With a small dataset of 200 labeled replies, I would primarily use transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like DistilBERT. These models have already learned vast language patterns, enabling them to perform well on a new task with minimal data. 



2. How would you ensure your reply classifier doesn’t produce biased or unsafe outputs in production?

I would set up continuous monitoring of the model's predictions to detect any performance disparities and also conduct continuous evaluation with test data.
I’d also add a moderation layer to detect toxic or irrelevant replies, ensuring the model doesn’t produce harmful classifications.

3. Suppose you want to generate personalized cold email openers using an LLM. What prompt design strategies would you use to keep outputs relevant and non-generic?

I would use a persona-based prompt, instructing the LLM to act as a sales expert with deep knowledge of the specific product. 
I would also use a few-shot learning approach, providing a few examples of highly effective and personalized openers to guide the LLM's style and tone. 
Finally, I would include specific contextual details about the recipient, their company, and their role, directing
